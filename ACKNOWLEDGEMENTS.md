# Acknowledgements & Copyright (ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS)

`cliedit` is an open-source project that utilizes components (or modified/converted versions thereof) from other open-source projects. We express our deep gratitude to the communities and authors who provided the foundation for these components.

All components listed below are included as vendored code (integrated directly into the project source code) and have been adapted to fit **cliedit**'s TypeScript architecture and remove unnecessary features (e.g., mouse support).
